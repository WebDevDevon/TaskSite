# TO-DO Site-2021

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript - Portfolio Site including links to my projects and ways to get in contact with me.

**Link to site:** https://dailytasksandtodos.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

## Optimizations

IF I had more time and knowledge on APIs I would add a local weather widget as a side feature. At the moment it does not have a save feature to come back to it later so figure that out and add some back end.

## Lessons Learned:

Always use fontawesome if you need a icon.
